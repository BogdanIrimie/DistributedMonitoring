For the monitoring module to work, the following dependencies must be satisfied:

- awk
- atop 2.2-3 (+ libncurses-dev, make)

The following commands can be run to install the dependencies on Ubuntu 14.04:

sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install make

<path to netatop> make
<patht o netatop> make install
sudo service netatop start


sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
